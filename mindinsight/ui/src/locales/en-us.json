    "mainTipPartOne":"This function visualizes the basis for model classification. After the to-be-explained model, the image, and the tag are selected, a contribution degree of each pixel in the original image to the selected tag is calculated by using an explanation method, and visualization is performed by using a saliency map similar to a heatmap. A brighter color indicates that the corresponding area contributes more to the selected tag of the model prediction. The darker the color, the smaller the contribution of the area to the selected tag.",
    "mainTipPartTwo":"A saliency map helps you understand the features related to the specified tag during deep neural network inference. When the inference basis and expectation of a model are different, you can debug the model by referring to the saliency map so that the model can perform inference based on proper features.",

Modify the corresponding positions in the original image according to a certain rule (for example, from bright to dark) and transfer the modified image to the model for inference in sequence. If the brighter the area of the saliency map is, the greater the impact on the selected tag is, the higher the faithfulness of the interpretation result is. Conversely, the explanation result may not reflect the inference basis of the model. Currently, there are three mainstream solutions: naive faithfulness, insertion AUC, and deletion AUC.",

If the explanation method accurately highlights the area related to the selected tag in the image, the highlighted area should overlap the bounding box of the selected objective. Localization assesses the location capability of the explanation result by assessing the overlapped area of the highlighted area and bounding box."
